Our apps for good website

I have made this website using a w3 layouts template. A lot of the html was already existent but i have changed the main colour of the website, replaced all the images in the website, added the video link, made navigation easier with the menu bar, have removed some unnecessary elements, and personalized the contents to suit our company and app. If you are opening this please do not preview it in internet explorer because the formatting is spoilt and the website appears in a different order with elements in different places.

To preview our website please open index.html then click the small tv screen on it that will say "open this file in github desktop"
